Experimenting with an Elm insipired approach to UI design, using F# with:
* [Elmish.WPF](https://github.com/elmish/Elmish.WPF/)
* [FSXaml](http://fsprojects.github.io/FsXaml/)

WPF UI elements heavily borrowed from [Dynamic trader](https://github.com/RolandPheasant/Dynamic.Trader/).

For a more fully featured, cross platform F# UI offering, consider the [Fabulous](https://fsprojects.github.io/Fabulous/) project.
